# react yelp

In this repo, I will learn to build a Yelp-like UI using React. I will follow the
tutorial [React Tutorial: Cloning Yelp](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/react-tutorial-cloning-yelp/) by
fullstackreact.com, but try to be playful and do my own exploration.

## Some techniques I learned

- [n-times loop in React](https://gist.github.com/mnishiguchi/1a686249b63582da2bcef23ecf6671fb)
- [Unix - creating multiple directories/files with one command](https://gist.github.com/mnishiguchi/5ba4b1f2463709cc9ce0151f313499a0)
